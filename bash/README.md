Download my config in the releases:
> https://github.com/kevinjmt/LinuxConfigs/releases/

decompress the folder. On Linux, use in your terminal:
```shell
tar â€“xvf KJBashConfig_v1_1.tar
```
and put it in the location of your NVim config folder.
By default, use:

```shell
cd KJBashConfig
cp * ~/
```


Relaunch your Bash to see if it works fine:
```shell
bash
```
Your Bash config is now ready.
